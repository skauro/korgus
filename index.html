                 I like to eat food, food is my one true love. I may be very skinny but eating is my favourite hobby, i could do it 24/7.<br>
                 My favourite foods are fried dumplings or some street burgers.I like healthy food aswell but i eat junk food lesser so that makes it better.<br>
                 All fresh food nowadays is not as healthy as it used to be before thats why i eat everything and try to not think about all the chemicals in it.<br>
                 Overall, food makes everyone happy and is something everyone can bond over, because everyone eats,<br> you could be living at the other side of the planet but still like the same food as someone who is not even remotely similiar to you.
